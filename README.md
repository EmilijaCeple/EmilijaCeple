## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!



ðŸ”­ I recently finished Data Analytics course at Turing College, where I've gained a strong foundation in data manipulation, visualization, and analytical problem-solving. My focus is on transforming raw data into actionable insights and uncovering trends that help inform strategic decisions.
